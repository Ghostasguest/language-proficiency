To setup two-step verification for your Google account and configure an app-specific password, follow these steps:

1. **Enable Two-Step Verification:**
   - Go to the [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) page.
   - Under "Signing in to Google", select "2-Step Verification" and follow the instructions to enable it.

2. **Generate App-Specific Password:**
   - After enabling two-step verification, go to the [App passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) page.
   - Click on "Select app" and choose "Other (Custom name)".
   - Enter any name for the app.
   - Click "Generate".
   - Copy the generated app-specific password. This password will be used to configure the app.

3. **Configure the App:**
   - Run the `configure.exe` file.
   - When prompted, paste the app-specific password you copied earlier.
   - Follow any additional instructions provided by the app.

4. **Schedule Automatic Execution:**
   - Press the Windows button and type "Task Scheduler".
   - Open the Task Scheduler app and navigate to "Task Scheduler Library".
   - In the "Actions" panel on the right, select "Create Task".
   - Enter a name for the task and check "Run whether user is logged in or not" and "Run with highest privileges" options.
   - Go to the "Triggers" tab and select "New".
   - Set "Begin the task" to "At system startup" and click "OK".
   - Repeat the above step two more times, but select "On disconnect from user session" and "On workstation lock" for the subsequent triggers.
   - In the "Actions" section, select "New", then browse and locate the `trigger.exe` file extracted from the app's zip folder.
   - Under the "Conditions" tab, uncheck all options.
   - In the "Settings" tab, check "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed" and all other desired options.

Your app is now configured to send alerts whenever the user enters a wrong password. Make sure to document these steps for future reference.
